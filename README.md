# ICFOSS-internship
Project on contibuting to Opensource dev board HiFive 1 rev B


We started the poject with only an understanding of C++ and basic knowledge of assembly language.
We got only limited support for programming SiFive 1 B with C/C++ and most help/files we found were in rust.

The files in this repository are ported from SiFive to support the new board. It also contains some files which are written from scratch using the documentation available in docs
